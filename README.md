## Homework 1

1. Make sure that your code runs _without errors_. Solutions that throw errors will receive 0 points. Make sure that your code runs without errors in a clean session to avoid failures when your code is executed on another machine. In R-Studio open Session, select Clear Workspace. Run all your code in one go and look in the R console for errors.
2. After you push a commit to github, your code will be automatically checked for errors. Go to your homework repository and open the commits view. A green tick next to your commit indicates that your code passes the tests (no errors). A red cross indicates that your code throws errors. A yellow dot means that your code is being examined (this can take some time). If you don't see a cross, a dot or a tick this means that your repository is not yet added to the automatic checking process.
3. Only submit relevant code and comments. Superfluous code/comments will lead to score reduction.
4. Make sure taht you submit _readable_ code. Follow the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html). Hard to read code will lead to a score reduction. You can ignore (2.1 Object names) of the style guide.
5. Before submitting, select all text in the file (in R Studio), open the Code menu and select Reformat Code.
6. Unless explicitly required, remove lines that print objects before submitting.
